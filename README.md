# LDA-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-

Linear Discrimination is used in classification to separate different categories of data points using a straight line (in 2D), a plane (in 3D), or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions)

In this example, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was applied on the Iris and Wine datasets from Sklearn to classify multiple classes while reducing dimensionality. 

In the Iris dataset (4 features, 3 classes), LDA achieved 100% accuracy, effectively separating Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica flowers. 

Similarly, in the Wine dataset (13 features, 3 classes), LDA maintained perfect classification.
