# LDA-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-

**Linear Discriminant Analysis** (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that projects data onto a lower-dimensional space while maximizing class separability.

This notebook applies LDA for classification on two well-known datasets: Iris and Wine. 

**Features**

- Loads Iris and Wine datasets from sklearn.datasets.

- Performs data preprocessing, including feature scaling.

- Implements LDA for dimensionality reduction and classification.

- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and classification reports.
